Personal Portfolio Webpage - README
Project Overview
The Personal Portfolio Webpage project is a part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. The objective of this project is to build a personal portfolio that showcases your work, skills, and online presence. The project is designed to help you practice HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles by creating a webpage that is similar in functionality to the example provided but with your unique personal style.

Objective
Build a portfolio webpage that is functionally similar to this example without copying it directly. The portfolio should include sections such as a welcome area, projects showcase, and navigation, all while adhering to the user stories provided.

User Stories
To successfully complete the project, ensure that your portfolio webpage fulfills the following requirements:

Welcome Section:

Your portfolio must include a welcome section with an id of welcome-section.
The welcome section should contain an h1 element that includes text welcoming visitors to your portfolio.
Projects Section:

Include a projects section with an id of projects.
The projects section must contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to display a project.
Each project tile should include a link to the corresponding project.
Navbar:

Your portfolio must have a navigation bar (navbar) with an id of navbar.
The navbar should include links that allow users to navigate to different sections of the page.
Profile Link:

Include a link with an id of profile-link that opens your GitHub or freeCodeCamp profile in a new tab.
Media Queries:

Your portfolio should be responsive and include at least one media query to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
Welcome Section Height:

The height of the welcome section should match the height of the viewport to create a full-screen introduction.
Sticky Navbar:

Ensure that the navbar remains at the top of the viewport as users scroll through the page.
Getting Started
HTML Structure: Begin by setting up the basic HTML structure for your webpage. Create sections for the welcome message, projects, and navigation bar.

CSS Styling: Apply styles to your HTML elements using CSS. Link your stylesheet by including the following line in your HTML:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Responsive Design: Use media queries to ensure your portfolio looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

Customization: Add your personal flair to the project by customizing colors, fonts, layout, and content. Make it reflect your personality and skills.

Testing: Ensure your portfolio meets all the user stories by testing it thoroughly. Double-check that all links work, sections are properly aligned, and the design is responsive.

Final Touches
Once you've completed the development of your personal portfolio webpage, review the project to ensure that it meets all the specified requirements. Validate your HTML and CSS for any errors, and optimize the page for performance.
